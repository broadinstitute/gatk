/**
 *  PerRecordCollector - An interface for classes that collect data in order to generate one or more metrics.
 *      This process usually occurs in the following fashion:
 *      1. Loop through a data set (usually all records in a BAM file) and call collector.acceptRecord( data ),
 *         data in this step is usually added to metrics/Histogram objects
 *      2. Call collector.finish() - perform any final calculations necessary after ALL records have been accepted
 *      3. addMetricsToFile is then used to add any metric(s) or Histogram(s) to the given file
 *
 *      BEAN    - The Metric type we are generating
 *      HKEY    - The Key used in any Histograms, use a Wildcard(?) type if there are no Histograms
 *      ARGTYPE - Collectors are often used in groups of accumulation levels, in order to avoid recalculating
 *                any information needed by multiple collectors we allow different types of arguments that
 *                extend DefaultPerRecordCollectorArgs to accommodate any computed values
