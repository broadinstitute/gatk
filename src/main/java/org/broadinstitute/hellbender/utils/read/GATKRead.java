/**
 * Unified read interface for use throughout the GATK.

 * Adapter classes implementing this interface exist for htsjdk's {@link SAMRecord} ({@link SAMRecordToGATKReadAdapter})
 *
 * Since the adapter classes wrap the raw reads without making a copy, care must be taken to avoid
 * exposing the encapsulated reads, particularly if modifying reads in-place. As a result, this interface
 * should probably only be implemented by core engine-level classes.
 *
 * All GATKRead methods that return mutable reference types make defensive copies, with the exception
 * of the conversion method {@link #convertToSAMRecord}.
 *
 * Note that {@link #getContig} and {@link #getStart} will not expose nominal positions assigned to unmapped
 * reads for sorting purposes -- for unmapped reads, these methods will always return {@code null} or 0,
 * respectively. To access positions assigned to unmapped reads for sorting purposes, use {@link #getAssignedContig}
