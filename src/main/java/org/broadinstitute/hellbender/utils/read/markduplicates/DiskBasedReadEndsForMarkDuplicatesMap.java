/**
 * Disk-based implementation of ReadEndsForMarkDuplicatesMap.  A subdirectory of the system tmpdir is created to store
 * files, one for each reference sequence.  The reference sequence that is currently being queried (i.e. the
 * sequence for which remove() has been most recently called) is stored in RAM.  ReadEnds for all other sequences
 * are stored on disk.
 * <p/>
 * When put() is called for a sequence that is the current one in RAM, the ReadEnds object is merely put into the
 * in-memory map.  If put() is called for a sequence ID that is not the current RAM one, the ReadEnds object is
 * appended to the file for that sequence, creating the file if necessary.
 * <p/>
 * When remove() is called for a sequence that is the current one in RAM, remove() is called on the in-memory map.
 * If remove() is called for a sequence other than the current RAM sequence, then the current RAM sequence is written
 * to disk, the new sequence is read from disk into RAM map, and the file for the new sequence is deleted.
 * <p/>
 * If things work properly, and reads are processed in genomic order, records will be written for mates that are in
 * a later sequence.  When the mate is reached in the input SAM file, the file that was written will be deleted.
 * This should result in all temporary files being deleted by the time all the reads are processed.  The temp
 * directory is marked to be deleted on exit so everything should get cleaned up.
