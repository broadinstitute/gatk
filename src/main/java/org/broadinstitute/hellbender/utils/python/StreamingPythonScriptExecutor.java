/**
 * Python executor used to interact with a cooperative, keep-alive Python process. The executor issues commands
 * to call Python functions in the {@code tool} module in {@code gatktool} Python package. These include functions
 * for managing an acknowledgement FIFO that is used to signal completion of Python commands, and a data FIFO that
 * can be used to stream data to Python.
 *
 *  - construct the executor
 *  - start the remote process ({@link #start}.
 *  - optionally call {@code #getStreamWriter} to initialize and create a data transfer fifo.
 *  - send one or more synchronous or asynchronous commands to be executed in Python
 *  - optionally send data one or more times of type {@ocde T} through the async writer
 *  - execute python code to close the data fifo
 *  - terminate the executor {@link #terminate}
 *
 * Guidelines for writing GATK tools that use Python interactively:
 *
 *   - Program correctness should not rely on consumption of anything written by Python to stdout/stderr. All
 *     data should be transferred through the stream writer or a file.
 *   - Python code should write errors to stderr.
 *   - Prefer single line commands that run a script, vs. multi-line Python code embedded in Java
 *   - Terminate commands with a newline.
 *   - Try not to be chatty (maximize use of the fifo buffer by writing to it in batches before reading from Python)
 *
 * @param <T> type of data that will be streamed to the Python process
