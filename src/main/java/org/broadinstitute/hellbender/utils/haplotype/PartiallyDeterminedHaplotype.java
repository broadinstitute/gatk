/**
 * Class for holding the PartiallyDeterminedHaplotype constructs that are needed for the PDHMM.
 *
 * The primary function of a "partiallyDeterminedHaplotype" is so that the PDHMM can compress the computation of Haplotype
 * score max's that gets marginalized in the genotyper down into a single HMM operation. You can think of each PDHMM haplotype
 * as being representative of a single allele in the genotyper (be that Ref or Alt) where every other discovered variant in the
 * entire region is "undetermined." An undetermined SNP might mean that either the REF or ALT bases at that site are treated
 * as matches within the HMM model. An undetermined INDEL is slightly more complicated, if its an undetermined deletion then
 * we expect the haplotype bases to match the reference and the mismatches to be recorded in the jump array. If the
 * undetermined event is an Insertion then we "flip" the insertion by adding the inserted bases to the reference haplotype
 * and treating it as undetermined for both.
 *
 * Differences of note from Haplotype:
 *  - alternateBases array - This is a hap-length array that stores summaries of the undetermined bases. For bases that don't
 *                           have any undetermined behavior the byte should simply be 0. Otherwise the bytes bear a representation
 *                           of the event as a bitset (with the keys for what each bit represents at the top of this class)
 *  - determinedPosition/alleleBearingVariantContext - Since we construct the PDHaps with only one event "determined" this position
 *                                                     and variant contexts store exactly WHAT that event is for the haplotype as
 *                                                     well as what position it counts as for various bookkeping tasks.
 *                                               NOTE: these are used for EventMap construction since for PDHaplotypes the
 *                                                     event map should contain ONLY this event.
 *  - isDeterminedAlleleRef - This variant simply accounts for whether or not this is a reference determined allele to be
 *                            assigned to reference when genotyping later on.
 *  - constituentBuiltEvents - Since this object is artifically constructed form a set of constituent events we may as well
 *                             store them here for debugging purposes.
 *
 * Known issues/limitations:
 *  - Despite having been assured by Illumina engineers that they do NOT allow undetermined SNPs to be in the middle of
 *    indels. I have found at least one edge case involving single base deletions competing with snps at the same base where
 *    DRAGEN 3.7.8 evidently breaks this rule. I'm not convinced this is terribly improtant to FE but it should be noted.
