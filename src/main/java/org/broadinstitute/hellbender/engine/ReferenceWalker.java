/**
 * A reference walker is a tool which processes each base in a given reference.  Each base can be processed individually
 * or in a context of multiple bases in a window.  Reads and Feature tracks can optionally be included as well. The
 * reference bases to process can be subset to a given set of intervals.
 *
 *  ReferenceWalker authors must implement the apply() method to process each position, and may optionally implement
 *  {@link #onTraversalStart()} and/or {@link #onTraversalSuccess()}.
 *
 *  Tool authors may also implement {@link #getReferenceWindow(SimpleInterval)} to provide additional bases of context
 *  around each position.
 *
 *  See the {@link ExampleReferenceWalker} walker for an example.
