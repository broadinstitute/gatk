/**
 * A ReadWalker is a tool that processes a single read at a time from one or multiple sources of reads, with
 * optional contextual information from a reference and/or sets of variants/Features.
 *
 * If multiple sources of reads are specified, they are merged together into a single sorted stream of reads.
 *
 * Reads will be:
 * - Transformed with {@link #makePreReadFilterTransformer()} before filtering.
 * - Filtered with {@link #makeReadFilter()} before post-transformers.
 * - Transformed with {@link #makePostReadFilterTransformer()} before processing.
 * - Passed to {@link #apply(GATKRead, ReferenceContext, FeatureContext)} for processing.
 *
 * ReadWalker authors must implement the apply() method to process each read, and may optionally implement
 * onTraversalStart() and/or onTraversalSuccess(). See the PrintReadsWithReference walker for an example.
