/**
 * Filter out reads that are over-soft-clipped
 *
 * <p>
 *     This filter is intended to filter out reads that are potentially from foreign organisms.
 *     From experience with sequencing of human DNA we have found cases of contamination by bacterial
 *     organisms; the symptoms of such contamination are a class of reads with only a small number
 *     of aligned bases and additionally many soft-clipped bases.  This filter is intended
 *     to remove such reads. Consecutive soft-clipped blocks are treated as a single block
 * </p>
