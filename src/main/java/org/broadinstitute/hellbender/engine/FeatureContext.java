/**
 * Wrapper around FeatureManager that presents Feature data from a particular interval to a client tool
 * without improperly exposing engine internals.
 *
 * The client passes in one or more FeatureInputs that were declared as tool arguments, and gets back a List
 * of all Features from those FeatureInputs overlapping the interval spanned by this FeatureContext.
 *
 * Features returned may optionally be additionally constrained to start at a particular position.
 *
 * Features are returned strongly-typed based on the type parameter of each FeatureInput requested,
 * so a query on a FeatureInput<VariantContext> will return VariantContext objects (no casting
 * required by tool authors).
 *
 * Feature sources are lazily queried, so there's no overhead if the client chooses not to examine
 * the FeatureContext it's passed.
 *
 * A FeatureContext may have no backing data source and/or interval. In these cases, queries on it will always
 * return empty Lists. You can determine whether there is a backing source of Features via
 * {@link #hasBackingDataSource()}, and whether there is an interval via {@link #getInterval}
 *
 * Note: This class is NOT intended to be extended outside of the testing harness.
