     * The assembled haplotypes and locally realigned reads will be written as BAM to this file if requested.  Really
     * for debugging purposes only. Note that the output here does not include uninformative reads so that not every
     * input read is emitted to the bam.
     *
     * Turning on this mode may result in serious performance cost for the caller.  It's really only appropriate to
     * use in specific areas where you want to better understand why the caller is making specific calls.
     *
     * The reads are written out containing an "HC" tag (integer) that encodes which haplotype each read best matches
     * according to the haplotype caller's likelihood calculation.  The use of this tag is primarily intended
     * to allow good coloring of reads in IGV.  Simply go to "Color Alignments By > Tag" and enter "HC" to more
     * easily see which reads go with these haplotype.
     *
     * Note that the haplotypes (called or all, depending on mode) are emitted as single reads covering the entire
     * active region, coming from sample "HC" and a special read group called "ArtificialHaplotype". This will increase the
     * pileup depth compared to what would be expected from the reads only, especially in complex regions.
     *
     * Note also that only reads that are actually informative about the haplotypes are emitted.  By informative we mean
     * that there's a meaningful difference in the likelihood of the read coming from one haplotype compared to
     * its next best haplotype.
     *
     * If multiple BAMs are passed as input to the tool (as is common for M2), then they will be combined in the bamout
     * output and tagged with the appropriate sample names.
     *
     * The best way to visualize the output of this mode is with IGV.  Tell IGV to color the alignments by tag,
     * and give it the "HC" tag, so you can see which reads support each haplotype.  Finally, you can tell IGV
     * to group by sample, which will separate the potential haplotypes from the reads.  All of this can be seen in
