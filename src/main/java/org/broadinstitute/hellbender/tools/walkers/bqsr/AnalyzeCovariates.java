/**
 * Tool to analyze and evaluate base recalibration tables.
 * <p/>
 * It generates plots to assess the quality of a recalibration run.
 *
 * <h3>Input</h3>
 *
 * The tool can take up to three different sets of recalibration tables.
 * The resulting plots will be overlaid on top of each other to make
 * comparisons easy.
 *
 * <table style="text-align: left">
 *     <thead>
 *       <tr><th>Set</th><th>Argument</th><th>Label</th><th>Color</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 *     </thead>
 *     <tbody>
 *       <tr><td>Original</td><td>-before</td><td>BEFORE</td><td style="color: #ff34b3">Maroon1</td>
 *         <td>First pass recalibration
 *             tables obtained from applying {@link BaseRecalibration}
 *             on the original alignment.</td></tr>
 *       <tr><td>Recalibrated</td><td>-after</td><td>AFTER</td><td style="color: #0000ff">Blue</td>
 *         <td>Second pass recalibration tables
 *             results from the application of {@link BaseRecalibration}
 *             on the alignment recalibrated using the first pass tables</td></tr>
 *       <tr><td>Input</td><td>-BQSR</td><td>BQSR</td><td style="color: #000000">Black</td>
 *           <td>Any recalibration table without a specific role</td></tr>
 *     </tbody>
 * </table>
 * <br/>
 *
 * You need to specify one set at least. Multiple sets need to have the same values for the following parameters:
 * <br/></br>
 * <i>covariate (order is not important), no_standard_covs, run_without_dbsnp, solid_recal_mode,
 * solid_nocall_strategy, mismatches_context_size, mismatches_default_quality, deletions_default_quality,
 * insertions_default_quality, maximum_cycle_value, low_quality_tail, default_platform, force_platform,
 * quantizing_levels</i> and <i>binary_tag_name</i>
 * <h3>Output</h3>
 *
 * Currently this tool generates two outputs:
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt style="font-weight: normal">-plots <i>my-report.pdf</i></dt>
 *   <dd>A pdf document that encloses plots to assess the quality of the recalibration.</dd>
 *   <dt style="font-weight: normal">-csv <i>my-report.csv</i></dt>
 *   <dd>A csv file that contains a table with all the data required to generate those plots.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * You need to specify at least one of them.
 *
 * <h3>Other Arguments</h3>
 *
 * <h4>-ignoreLMT, --ignoreLastModificationTimes</h4>
 *
 * when set, no warning message will be displayed in the -before recalibration table file is older than the -after one.
