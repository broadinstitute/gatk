     * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity#Heterozygosity_in_population_genetics

     * That is, a hets value of 0.01 implies that two randomly chosen chromosomes from the population of organisms
     * would differ from each other (one being A and the other B) at a rate of 1 in 100 bp.
     *
     * Note that this quantity has nothing to do with the likelihood of any given sample having a heterozygous genotype,
     * which in the GATK is purely determined by the probability of the observed data P(D | AB) under the model that there
     * may be a AB het genotype.  The posterior probability of this AB genotype would use the het prior, but the GATK
     * only uses this posterior probability in determining the prob. that a site is polymorphic.  So changing the
     * het parameters only increases the chance that a site will be called non-reference across all samples, but
     * doesn't actually change the output genotype likelihoods at all, as these aren't posterior probabilities at all.
     *
     * The quantity that changes whether the GATK considers the possibility of a het genotype at all is the ploidy,
     * which determines how many chromosomes each individual in the species carries.
