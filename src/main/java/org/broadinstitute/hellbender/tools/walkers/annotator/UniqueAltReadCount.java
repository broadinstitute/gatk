/**
 * This annotation counts, at each variant locus, the number of ALT reads with unique start positions and fragment lengths.
 * i.e. multiple reads with the same start position and fragment length are grouped and counted only once as they are
 * likely duplicates. We have seen that the majority of false positives in low allele fraction, cell-free DNA samples
 * have the profile where the evidence for alternate allele comes solely from one, two, or three sets of apparent PCR-duplicates.
 * Reads in such a set have the same read-start and mate-end position i.e. they come from the same original insert.
 * Normally, they are marked as duplicates by MarkDuplicates2. But when we use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs),
 * these apparent PCR-duplicate reads may get different UMIs, and hence to Mutect these reads appear as
 * independent evidence for ALT allele.
 *
 * Although these reads have different UMIs, we suspect that they really are PCR-duplicates, for two reasons:
 * 1) these sites are false positives, and
 * 2) with hybrid selection, it's highly unlikely that we sequence multiple fragments with identical start and end positions.
 *
 * We now believe that these duplicates are the result of a false-priming event that occurs during PCR amplification.
 * We suspect that during amplification excess adapter remains after the ligation step and fails to be completely
 * cleaned up during SPRI. This excess adapter is thought to act as a PCR primer during amplification, which leads to
 * the synthesis of a molecule with the wrong UMI.
 *
 * We filter the variant if the count is lower than a user-specified threshold.
 * Mutect2FilteringEngine::applyDuplicatedAltReadFilter is the accompanying filter.
