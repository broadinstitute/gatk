hg19mini.fasta	All sequence names and lengths present in the sequence dictionaries match, but example_variants_withSequenceDict_withoutmd5s_missingchr1.vcf is a subset of hg19mini.fasta. Missing sequence(s): [1]. Since the MD5s are lacking, we can't confirm there aren't mismatching bases in the references.
