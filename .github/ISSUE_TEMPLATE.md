### Instructions

- Determine whether your issue is a **bug report**, a **feature request**, or a **documentation request** (for tool gatkdocs only; for forum docs see [the support issues repo](https://github.com/broadinstitute/dsde-docs/issues));
- Consider if your "issue" is better addressed on the GATK forum: http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk  Post there if you have questions about expected tool behavior, output format, unexpected results or generally any question that does not fit the categories above;
- Use a **concise** yet **descriptive** title;
- Choose the corresponding template block below and fill it in, replacing or deleting text in italics (surrounded by `_`) as appropriate;
- If the issue will be added to the public tracker (using the `public` label), it must conform to [these guidelines](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/dsde/discussion/6801/guidelines-for-tagging-issues-with-the-public-tag#latest);
- Delete the other template blocks and this header.
