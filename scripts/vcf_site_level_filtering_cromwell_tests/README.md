# Filtering Automated Tests for WDL

**This directory is for GATK devs only**

This directory contains scripts for running Variant Site Level WDL tests in the automated build environment.

Please note that this only tests whether the WDL will complete successfully.

Test data is a "plumbing test" using a small portion of a 10 sample callset.
