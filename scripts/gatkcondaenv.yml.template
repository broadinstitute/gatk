# $condaEnvDescription
#
# Only update this environment if there is a *VERY* good reason to do so!
# If the build is broken but could be fixed by doing something else, then do that thing instead.
# Ensuring the correct environment for canonical (or otherwise reasonable) usage of our standard Docker takes precedence over edge cases.
# If you break the environment, you are responsible for fixing it and also owe the last developer who left this in a reasonable state a beverage of their choice.
# (This may be yourself, and you'll appreciate that beverage while you tinker with dependencies!)
#
# When changing dependencies or versions in this file, check to see if the "supportedPythonPackages" DataProvider
# used by the testGATKPythonEnvironmentPackagePresent test in PythonEnvironmentIntegrationTest needs to be updated
# to reflect the changes.
