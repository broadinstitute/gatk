## Introduction to the Genomic Variant Store workflow

The [Genomic Variant Store (GVS)](../gvs-product-sheet.pdf) was developed by the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard as a solution for variant discovery on a large scale. The GVS is powered by BigQuery and creates large joint callsets more reliably with decreased time and cost compared to previous solutions.

The [GVS workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/ah_var_store/scripts/variantstore/wdl/GvsJointVariantCalling.wdl) is an open-source, cloud-optimized workflow for joint calling at a large scale using the Terra platform. The workflow takes in single sample GVCF files, loads them into [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs) tables, and combines them into a variant filtering model driven by machine learning. The model is uploaded back into BigQuery and applied to the data. The workflow produces sharded joint VCF files with indices, a manifest file, and metrics.

The filtering model is based on the [GATK best practices Joint Genotyping workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/joint_genotyping/JointGenotyping.wdl) and is created using [Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR)](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531612) technique, which uses machine learning to model the technical profile of variants and flag probable artifacts.

## Setup

### Workflow requirements

#### Terra, Google Cloud, and BigQuery

The GVS workflow needs to be run in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/), a cloud-based platform for biomedical research. The workflow relies on the structure of workspace data tables to call input sample files. The workflow also requires that you have a Terra account, billing project, and BigQuery dataset with permissions that allow Terra to access it. For step-by-step instructions for setting up these requirements, see the [GVS Beta Quickstart](./gvs-quickstart.md).

#### Input GVCF files

The GVS workflow takes in reblocked GVCF files as input. If your files are not already reblocked, you can reblock them using the [WARP reblocking workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/joint_genotyping/reblocking/ReblockGVCF.wdl), which is configured in the [ReblockGVCF Terra workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/warp-pipelines/ReblockGVCF). For more information about reblocking, check out [WARP Whole Genome and Exome Pipelines Produce Reblocked GVCFs](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/blog/tags/reblock/).

The workflow also requires specific annotations in input GVCF files, which are described in the tutorial, [Upload data to Terra and run the GVS workflow](./run-your-own-samples.md).

### Inputs

The GVS workflow inputs are described in the sections below and are specified in the Terra GVS beta workspace [workflow configuration](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/gvs-prod/Genomic_Variant_Store_Beta/workflows/help-terra/GvsJointVariantCalling).

The workflow is configured to use hg38 (aka GRCh38) as the reference genome.

#### Sample data

The GVS workflow takes in reblocked single sample GVCF files and their corresponding index files as `input_vcfs` and `input_vcf_indexes`, respectively. While the GVS workflow has been tested with 100,000 single sample GVCF files as input, only datasets of up to 10,000 samples are being used for beta testing.

The [GVS beta workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/gvs-prod/Genomic_Variant_Store_Beta) has been configured with example reblocked GVCF files that you can use to test the workflow.

#### Input descriptions

The table below describes the GVS workflow input variables:

| Input variable name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dataset_name | Name of the BigQuery dataset used to hold input samples, filtering model data, and other tables created during the workflow. | String |
| project_id | Name of the Google project that contains the BigQuery dataset. | String |
| external_sample_names | Unique sample IDs used in creation of output VCF file; `sample_id` in the sample data table in Terra. | Array of strings |
| input_vcfs | Cloud paths to the sample GVCF files. | Array of files |
| input_vcf_indexes | Cloud paths to the sample GVCF index files. | Array of files |
| call_set_identifier | Used to name the filter model, BigQuery extract tables, and final joint VCF shards; should begin with a letter; valid characters include A-z, 0-9, “.”, “,”, “-“, and “_”. | String |
| extract_output_gcs_dir | Optional; desired cloud path for output files. | String |

## Tasks and tools

Overall, the GVS workflow:

1. Imports sample GVCF files.
1. Trains the filtering model.
1. Extracts VCF files.

The steps of the workflow, in addition to the GATK tools used in each step, are described below. Custom tools are used throughout the workflow to read from and write to the BigQuery dataset.

### 1. Import sample GVCF files

This step validates that sample GVCF files contain required annotations and loads samples into BigQuery tables. 

### 2. Train the filtering model

GATK tools used: [SplitIntervals](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/5358914364699), [GatherVcfsCloud](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/5358884598555), [VariantRecalibrator](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/5358906115227), [GatherTranches](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/5358889613339)

This step splits alternate alleles, calculates annotations to be used for filtering, and creates a filtering model using VQSR and annotations from a random subset of the input samples.
SNPs are recalibrated using the annotations `AS_FS`, `AS_ReadPosRankSum`, `AS_MQRankSum`, `AS_QD`, and `AS_SOR`. Indels are recalibrated using the annotations `AS_FS`, `AS_ReadPosRankSum`, `AS_MQRankSum`, `AS_QD`, `AS_SOR`, and `AS_MQ`.

### 3. Extract VCF files

GATK tools used: [SplitIntervals](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/5358914364699)

This step calculates annotations including allele count (`AC`), allele number (`AN`), and allele frequency (`AF`), and creates and outputs a sharded joint VCF file. The output VCF file includes desired samples, calculated annotations, and flagged probable artifacts. The output VCF file is split so shards do not span multiple chromosomes.

## Outputs

The final outputs of the GVS workflow are described in the table below: 

| Output variable name | Description | Type | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| output_vcfs | Sharded VCF files with variant calls. | Array of VCF files |
| output_vcf_indexes | Sharded VCF index files for the output VCF files. | Array of VCF index files |
| total_vcfs_size_mb | Float describing the total size of the output VCF files in MB. | Float |
| manifest | TXT file listing output file destinations and other metadata. | TXT | 

The GVS workflow outputs a sharded joint VCF file containing filter sites and genotypes flagged as probable artifacts and annotations calculated during the `GvsExtractCallset` subworkflow, including allele count (`AC`), allele number (`AN`), and allele frequency (`AF`). The output VCF file is sharded so that no shards span multiple chromosomes. 

The [GVS beta workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/gvs-prod/Genomic_Variant_Store_Beta) is configured to write the outputs of the workflow back to the `sample_set` data table.
