## Overview
Through this QuickStart you will learn how to use the Broad Genomic Variant Store to create a GATK VQSR Filtered joint callset VCF for 10 whole genome samples. The sequencing data in this quickstart came from the [AnVIL 1000G High Coverage workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/1000G-high-coverage-2019).


## Prerequisites
This quickstart assumes that you are familiar with Terra workspaces, the data model and providing input parameters and launching workflows.

1. You will need to have or create a BigQuery dataset (we'll call this `dataset_name` later on).
2. Grant the "BigQuery Data Editor" role on that **dataset** to your Terra PROXY group.  Your proxy group name can be found on your Terra Profile page and look something like `PROXY_12345678901234567890@firecloud.org`.
3. Grant the following roles on the Google **project** (we'll call this `project_id` later on) containing the dataset to your proxy group:
    - BigQuery data editor
    - BigQuery job user
    - BigQuery Read Session User
4. These tools expect re-blocked gVCF files as input, which are provided in this workspace

## 1. Import Data
A sample set for the quickstart has already been created with 10 samples and paths to re-blocked gVCFs for each sample.  Run the two import workflows against this sample set by selecting "sample_set" as the root entity type ("Step 1" on the workflow submission page) and `gvs_demo-10` for the data ("Step 2" on the workflow submission page).  If you are creating your own sample set, note that the sample table should have columns for the re-blocked gVCFs (`hg38_reblocked_gvcf` or `reblocked_gvcf_path`) and their index files.

## 1.1 Assign Gvs IDs and Create Loading Tables
To optimize the internal queries, each sample must have a unique and consecutive integer ID assigned. Run the `GvsAssignIds` workflow, which will create an appropriate ID for each sample in the sample set and update the BigQuery dataset with the sample name to ID mapping info.

This workflow should be run on a **sample set** as the root entity, for this workspace, the `gvs_demo_10` sample set.

These are the required parameters which must be supplied to the workflow:

| Parameter             | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| dataset_name          | the name of the dataset you created above       |
| external_sample_names | `this.samples.sample_id` (the sample identifier column from the `gvs_demo_10` sample set) |
| project_id            | the name of the google project containing the dataset |

## 1.2 Load data
Next, your re-blocked gVCF files will be copied into the `ref_ranges_*` and `vet_*` tables by running the `GvsImportGenomes` workflow.

This workflow should be run on a **sample set** as the root entity, for this workspace, the `gvs_demo_10` sample set.

These are the required parameters which must be supplied to the workflow:

| Parameter             | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| dataset_name          | the name of the dataset you created above       |
| external_sample_names | `this.samples.sample_id` (the sample identifier from the `gvs_demo_10` sample set) |
| input_vcf_indexes     | `this.samples.hg38_reblocked_gvcf_index` (reblocked gvcf index file for each sample) |
| input_vcfs            | `this.samples.hg38_reblocked_gvcf` (reblocked gvcf file for each sample) |
| project_id            | the name of the google project containing the dataset |

## 2. Create Alt Allele Table
This step loads data into the ALT_ALLELE table from the `vet_*` tables.

This workflow does not use the Terra data model to run, so be sure to select `Run workflow with inputs defined by file paths`.

This is done by running the `GvsCreateAltAllele` workflow with the following parameters:

| Parameter         | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| dataset_name      | the name of the dataset you created above  |
| project_id        | the name of the google project containing the dataset |

## 3. Create Filter Set
This step calculates features from the ALT_ALLELE table, trains the VQSR filtering model along with site-level QC filters, and loads them into BigQuery into a series of `filter_set_*` tables.  

This workflow does not use the Terra data model to run, so be sure to select `Run workflow with inputs defined by file paths`.

This is done by running the `GvsCreateFilterSet` workflow with the following parameters:

| Parameter                         | Description |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| dataset_name                      | the name of the dataset you created above  |
| filter_set_name                   | a unique name to identify this filter set (e.g. `my_demo_filters`); you will want to make note of this for use in step 5 |
| INDEL_VQSR_max_gaussians_override | you don't need to set this unless a previous run of IndelsVariantRecalibrator task failed to converge, start with 3 and lower as needed |
| project_id                        | the name of the google project containing the dataset |
| SNP_VQSR_max_gaussians_override   | you don't need to set this unless a previous run of SNPsVariantRecalibratorClassic task failed to converge, start with 5 and lower as needed |

## 4. Prepare Callset
This step performs the heavy lifting in BigQuery to gather all the data required to create a jointly called VCF.

This is done by running the `GvsPrepareRangesCallset` workflow with the following parameters:

| Parameter            | Description |
|--------------------- | ----------- |
| dataset_name         | the name of the dataset you created above  |
| extract_table_prefix | A unique, descriptive name for the tables containing the callset (for simplicity, you can use the same name you used for `filter_set_name` in step 3); you will want to make note of this for use in the next step |
| project_id           | the name of the google project containing the dataset |

## 5. Extract Cohort
Now the data is ready to be extracted!

This workflow does not use the Terra data model to run, so be sure to select `Run workflow with inputs defined by file paths`.

This is done by running the `GvsExtractCallset` workflow with the following parameters:

| Parameter            | Description              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------|
| dataset_name         | the name of the dataset you created above  |
| extract_table_prefix | the unique, descriptive name for the tables containing the callset you chose in step 4  |
| filter_set_name      | the name of the filter set created in step 3  |
| project_id           | the name of the google project containing the dataset |
| scatter_count        | how wide to scatter the extract task (use 100 for the Quickstart's 10 samples) |

## 6. Your VCF files are ready!

The sharded VCF output files are listed in the `ExtractTask.output_vcf` workflow output, and the associated index files are listed in `ExtractTask.output_vcf_index`.
