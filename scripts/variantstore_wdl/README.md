This directory has the WDLs for generating and interacting with a variant store in BigQuery. It currently contains
`ImportArrayManifest.wdl` which uploads the `probe_info` table from a Manifest file. Other WDLs for ingesting the array 
data, calculating metrics, and extracting array data are coming soon.
